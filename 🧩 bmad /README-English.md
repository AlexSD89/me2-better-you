## Overview

**BMad Method's Two Key Innovations:**

**1. Hybrid Intelligence Architecture:** Revolutionary upgrade from mechanical YAML conditions to intelligent agent decision-making. Our new hybrid intelligence system analyzes project context, team composition, and complexity to make smart decisions about which agents to use, how deep to go, and what interaction patterns work best.

**2. Agentic Planning:** Dedicated agents (Analyst, PM, Architect) collaborate with you to create detailed, consistent PRDs and Architecture documents. Through advanced prompt engineering and human-in-the-loop refinement, these planning agents produce comprehensive specifications that go far beyond generic AI task generation.

**3. Context-Engineered Development:** The Scrum Master agent then transforms these detailed plans into hyper-detailed development stories that contain everything the Dev agent needs - full context, implementation details, and architectural guidance embedded directly in story files.

This three-phase approach eliminates **mechanical decision-making**, **planning inconsistency** and **context loss** - the biggest problems in AI-assisted development. Your system now intelligently adapts to your specific project needs rather than following rigid workflows.

**📖 [See the complete workflow in the User Guide](docs/user-guide.md)** - Hybrid intelligence system, planning phase, development cycle, and all agent roles

## 🧠 What's New in v5.0: Hybrid Intelligence

### Revolutionary Upgrade: From Mechanical to Intelligent

**Before v5.0 (Mechanical System)**:
- ❌ Static YAML conditions: `include_if_ui_requirements_detected`
- ❌ Rigid skip conditions: `["api_only", "backend_service"]`
- ❌ Pre-defined intelligence modes that couldn't adapt
- ❌ One-size-fits-all workflows regardless of project complexity

**v5.0 Hybrid Intelligence System**:
- ✅ **Smart Project Analysis**: AI agents deeply understand your project type, complexity, and team context
- ✅ **Dynamic Agent Selection**: System intelligently chooses which agents to include based on actual needs
- ✅ **Adaptive Interaction Modes**: Changes how it interacts with you based on project certainty and your expertise
- ✅ **Context-Aware Workflows**: Workflows that understand and adapt to your specific situation
- ✅ **Transparent Decision Making**: Every intelligent decision comes with clear reasoning

### Key Architectural Changes

#### 🎯 Intelligence Injection Points
Every workflow now has 3 core intelligence injection points:
1. **Project Intelligence**: Deep analysis of your project replacing mechanical keyword matching
2. **Workflow Orchestrator**: Smart agent selection and workflow optimization
3. **Interaction Orchestrator**: Adaptive user experience based on context and confidence

#### 🧠 Brain-Tier Intelligence Enhancement
All core agents now have intelligent counterparts:
- `analyst` → `intelligent-analyst` (with predictive requirement analysis)
- `pm` → `intelligent-pm` (with adaptive PRD generation)
- `architect` → `intelligent-architect` (with pattern recognition)
- `sm` → `intelligent-sm` (with story optimization)
- `po` → `intelligent-po` (with risk-based validation)
- `bmad-orchestrator` → `intelligent-bmad-orchestrator` (with system optimization)
- `bmad-master` → `intelligent-bmad-master` (with adaptive execution)

#### 📊 100% Backward Compatibility
- ✅ All existing agent names and commands work exactly the same
- ✅ All existing workflows and team configurations remain functional
- ✅ Zero breaking changes - you can upgrade safely
- ✅ Gradual adoption - enable intelligence features when ready

## Quick Navigation

### Understanding the BMad Workflow

**Before diving in, review these critical workflow diagrams that explain how BMad works:**

1. **[Planning Workflow (Web UI)](docs/user-guide.md#the-planning-workflow-web-ui)** - How to create PRD and Architecture documents
2. **[Core Development Cycle (IDE)](docs/user-guide.md#the-core-development-cycle-ide)** - How SM, Dev, and QA agents collaborate through story files

> ⚠️ **These diagrams explain 90% of BMad Method Agentic Agile flow confusion** - Understanding the PRD+Architecture creation and the SM/Dev/QA workflow and how agents pass notes through story files is essential - and also explains why this is NOT taskmaster or just a simple task runner!

## Important: Keep Your BMad Installation Updated

**Stay up-to-date effortlessly!** If you already have BMad-Method installed in your project, simply run:

```bash
npx bmad-method install
# OR
git pull
npm run install:bmad
```

This will:

- ✅ Automatically detect your existing v4 installation
- ✅ Update only the files that have changed and add new files
- ✅ Create `.bak` backup files for any custom modifications you've made
- ✅ Preserve your project-specific configurations

This makes it easy to benefit from the latest improvements, bug fixes, and new agents without losing your customizations!

## Quick Start

### One Command for Everything (IDE Installation)

**Just run one of these commands:**

```bash
npx bmad-method install
# OR explicitly use stable tag:
npx bmad-method@stable install
# OR if you already have BMad installed:
git pull
npm run install:bmad
```

This single command handles:

- **New installations** - Sets up BMad in your project
- **Upgrades** - Updates existing installations automatically
- **Expansion packs** - Installs any expansion packs you've added to package.json

> **That's it!** Whether you're installing for the first time, upgrading, or adding expansion packs - these commands do everything.

**Prerequisites**: [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) v20+ required

### Fastest Start: Web UI Full Stack Team at your disposal (2 minutes)

1. **Get the bundle**: Save or clone the [full stack team file](dist/teams/team-fullstack.txt) or choose another team
2. **Create AI agent**: Create a new Gemini Gem or CustomGPT
3. **Upload & configure**: Upload the file and set instructions: "Your critical operating instructions are attached, do not break character as directed"
4. **Start Ideating and Planning**: Start chatting! Type `*help` to see available commands or pick an agent like `*analyst` to start right in on creating a brief.
5. **CRITICAL**: Talk to BMad Orchestrator in the web at ANY TIME (#bmad-orchestrator command) and ask it questions about how this all works!
6. **When to move to the IDE**: Once you have your PRD, Architecture, optional UX and Briefs - its time to switch over to the IDE to shard your docs, and start implementing the actual code! See the [User guide](docs/user-guide.md) for more details

### Alternative: Clone and Build

```bash
git clone https://github.com/bmadcode/bmad-method.git
npm run install:bmad # build and install all to a destination folder
```

## 🌟 Beyond Software Development - Expansion Packs

BMad's natural language framework works in ANY domain. Expansion packs provide specialized AI agents for creative writing, business strategy, health & wellness, education, and more. Also expansion packs can expand the core BMad-Method with specific functionality that is not generic for all cases. [See the Expansion Packs Guide](docs/expansion-packs.md) and learn to create your own!

## Codebase Flattener Tool

The BMad-Method includes a powerful codebase flattener tool designed to prepare your project files for AI model consumption. This tool aggregates your entire codebase into a single XML file, making it easy to share your project context with AI assistants for analysis, debugging, or development assistance.

### Features

- **AI-Optimized Output**: Generates clean XML format specifically designed for AI model consumption
- **Smart Filtering**: Automatically respects `.gitignore` patterns to exclude unnecessary files
- **Binary File Detection**: Intelligently identifies and excludes binary files, focusing on source code
- **Progress Tracking**: Real-time progress indicators and comprehensive completion statistics
- **Flexible Output**: Customizable output file location and naming

### Usage

```bash
# Basic usage - creates flattened-codebase.xml in current directory
npx bmad-method flatten

# Specify custom input directory
npx bmad-method flatten --input /path/to/source/directory
npx bmad-method flatten -i /path/to/source/directory

# Specify custom output file
npx bmad-method flatten --output my-project.xml
npx bmad-method flatten -o /path/to/output/codebase.xml

# Combine input and output options
npx bmad-method flatten --input /path/to/source --output /path/to/output/codebase.xml
```

### Example Output

The tool will display progress and provide a comprehensive summary:

```text
📊 Completion Summary:
✅ Successfully processed 156 files into flattened-codebase.xml
📁 Output file: /path/to/your/project/flattened-codebase.xml
📏 Total source size: 2.3 MB
📄 Generated XML size: 2.1 MB
📝 Total lines of code: 15,847
🔢 Estimated tokens: 542,891
📊 File breakdown: 142 text, 14 binary, 0 errors
```

The generated XML file contains your project's text-based source files in a structured format that AI models can easily parse and understand, making it perfect for code reviews, architecture discussions, or getting AI assistance with your BMad-Method projects.

#### Advanced Usage & Options

- CLI options
  - `-i, --input <path>`: Directory to flatten. Default: current working directory or auto-detected project root when run interactively.
  - `-o, --output <path>`: Output file path. Default: `flattened-codebase.xml` in the chosen directory.
- Interactive mode
  - If you do not pass `--input` and `--output` and the terminal is interactive (TTY), the tool will attempt to detect your project root (by looking for markers like `.git`, `package.json`, etc.) and prompt you to confirm or override the paths.
  - In non-interactive contexts (e.g., CI), it will prefer the detected root silently; otherwise it falls back to the current directory and default filename.
- File discovery and ignoring
  - Uses `git ls-files` when inside a git repository for speed and correctness; otherwise falls back to a glob-based scan.
  - Applies your `.gitignore` plus a curated set of default ignore patterns (e.g., `node_modules`, build outputs, caches, logs, IDE folders, lockfiles, large media/binaries, `.env*`, and previously generated XML outputs).
- Binary handling
  - Binary files are detected and excluded from the XML content. They are counted in the final summary but not embedded in the output.
- XML format and safety
  - UTF-8 encoded file with root element `<files>`.
  - Each text file is emitted as a `<file path="relative/path">` element whose content is wrapped in `<![CDATA[ ... ]]>`.
  - The tool safely handles occurrences of `]]>` inside content by splitting the CDATA to preserve correctness.
  - File contents are preserved as-is and indented for readability inside the XML.
- Performance
  - Concurrency is selected automatically based on your CPU and workload size. No configuration required.
  - Running inside a git repo improves discovery performance.

#### Minimal XML example

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<files>
  <file path="src/index.js"><![CDATA[
    // your source content
  ]]></file>
</files>
```
